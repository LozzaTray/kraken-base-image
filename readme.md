# kraken

This repository, despite the name, does not contain the main components for the Kraken build system. Instead, it
provides tools to _use_ Kraken. Currently, these tools are just one Docker image that contains all kinds of software
that may be required to successfully build projects with Kraken, such as multiple Python versions, Rust, Docker, etc.

## Usage

    ghcr.io/kraken-build/kraken:latest
